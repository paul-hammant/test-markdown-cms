## Ingredients

### For the Croutons:
- 4 cups cubed bread (preferably day-old sourdough or baguette)
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt to taste

### For the Dressing:
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 anchovy fillets (or 1 tsp anchovy paste)
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 150ml olive oil
- 50g Parmesan cheese, finely grated
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### For the Salad:
- 2 large romaine lettuce hearts, washed and torn
- 50g Parmesan cheese shavings
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. **Make croutons:** Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F). Toss bread cubes with olive oil, garlic, and salt. Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes until golden and crispy.

2. **Prepare the dressing:** In a food processor or with a mortar and pestle, mash garlic and anchovies into a paste.

3. **Emulsify:** Add egg yolk, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well.

4. **Add oil:** While whisking constantly (or with the food processor running), slowly drizzle in olive oil until the dressing is thick and creamy.

5. **Finish dressing:** Stir in grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. **Assemble salad:** Place romaine lettuce in a large bowl. Add dressing and toss until leaves are well coated.

7. **Serve:** Top with croutons, Parmesan shavings, and freshly ground black pepper.

## Tips

- For a coddled egg (safer option), boil the egg for 1 minute before using.
- Make the dressing up to 2 days ahead and store in the refrigerator.
- The anchovies are essential for authentic Caesar flavor!
- Massage the dressing into the lettuce for the best coating.
