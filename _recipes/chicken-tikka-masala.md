- 200g plain yogurt
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp cumin

### For the Sauce:
- 3 tbsp butter

## Instructions

1. **Marinate the chicken:** Mix yogurt, lemon juice, and spices in a bowl. Add chicken pieces and marinate for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight in the refrigerator).

2. **Cook the chicken:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook marinated chicken until browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Remove and set aside.

3. **Make the sauce:** In the same skillet, melt butter and sauté onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger, cook for 1 minute.

4. **Add spices:** Stir in garam masala, cumin, and paprika. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.

5. **Simmer:** Add crushed tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. **Finish the sauce:** Stir in heavy cream and return the chicken to the skillet. Simmer for 10 more minutes until sauce thickens.

7. **Serve:** Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve over basmati rice or with naan bread.

## Tips
