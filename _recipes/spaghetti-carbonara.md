## Ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated
- Black pepper to taste
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.

2. While the pasta cooks, fry the pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.

3. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Add a generous amount of black pepper.

4. When the pasta is done, reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.

5. Remove the skillet with pancetta from heat. Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss to combine.

6. Quickly add the egg and cheese mixture to the hot pasta, tossing constantly. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time to create a creamy sauce.

7. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino Romano and black pepper on top.

## Tips

- The key is to work quickly so the eggs create a creamy sauce without scrambling.
- Use freshly grated cheese for the best flavor and texture.
- Traditional carbonara doesn't include cream!
